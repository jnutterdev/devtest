                      <p><p>Hi, if you didn’t know already, my name is John Nutter. I’m a back end web developer and linux sysadmin. I have a passion working with Ruby on Rails, and seeking any opportunity I can to write code using it. In this first post, I’m going to go over some details on how I created this site, and the tools that I used. It’s not at all an exhaustive post, but just something I put together to get the ball rolling.</p>
