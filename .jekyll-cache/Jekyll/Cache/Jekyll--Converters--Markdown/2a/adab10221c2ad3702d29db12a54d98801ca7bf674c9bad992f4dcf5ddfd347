I"ö<p>Hello, my name is John Nutter. Iâ€™m a customer support technician that has been working for an Atlanta based software company for the last six years. I have a background in web development, with experience using PHP, Python, and Ruby. My passion is using Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>My goal is to find a position as a back end developer where I can bring my knowledge of working with Linux based systems. I would also incorporate my understanding of programming languages, and apply my love of problem-solving and troubleshooting to this role.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not working, Iâ€™m playing; either on my bass guitar, 80s synthesizers, or various music production software, such as     Ableton Live or Reaper. Iâ€™ve released a few albums over the years, but mostly as a hobby. I also have my own digital and so on-to-be cassette label.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not working or playing music, Iâ€™m watching sci-fi shows, reading comic books, listening to podcasts, or catching up on the latest industry news.</p>
