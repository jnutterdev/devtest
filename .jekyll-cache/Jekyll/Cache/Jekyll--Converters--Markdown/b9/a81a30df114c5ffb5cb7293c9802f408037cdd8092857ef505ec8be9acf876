I"Î<p>The updates Iâ€™m going to be sharing lately will mostly be for the projects Iâ€™m working on. Which in this case, will just be the current website and also the <a href="https://www.nutterhomedesigns.com">Nutter Home Designs</a> website. Sometime in the near future, Iâ€™m going to be working on some Ruby on rails apps so Iâ€™ll share those as Iâ€™m working through them.

<p>When I first setup this website, I was given a few pages to start off with, such as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> page, an <code class="highlighter-rouge">elements.md</code> page, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">landing.md</code> page. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">elements.md</code> page is just a resource to tell you what styles, fonts, and colors were used on the website. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">landing.md</code> page is there as a reference to see how the pages are layed outâ€“I think.</p>

<p>So anyways, I added an about page and saw that it displayed on the index page as a tile. I tried to add a new page for projects but didnâ€™t see it display. In an effort to try and get the page up, I quickly edited the elements page to say what I wanted it to say and then continued getting the rest of the website setup.</p>

<p>Last night, I decided to circle back and get things sorted out with the elements page. The first thing I tried to do is rename the elements file to projects, but that didnâ€™t work. It displayed an empty tile that linked directly to the siteâ€™s main CSS file.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I renamed the file back to elements and then dug through all of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> folders, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folders in the project. There was no noticeable reference to the elements file. I was perplexed.</p>

<p>Eventually, I created a brand new projects file. Copied the contents of the elements file to the projects file. Updated the frontmatter in the projects file and bingo, I could now see the tile appear on the index page. BUT, the old elements tile also displayed. Definitlely getting closer here, but was beyond confused.</p>

<p>With this project, the creator added a couple of options in the frontmatter for pages and posts which gave the option to <code class="highlighter-rouge">show_tile: true/false</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">show-nav: true/false</code>. I changed the frontmatter on the elements page to <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> for both, and then set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> on the projects page. Refreshed the index page, and noticed some improvement. The elements page was removed from the top navigation, but displayed as a blank space on the index page.</p>

<p>Ok, Iâ€™m getting closer. I started looking at other files in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folder to see how they were coded. Thereâ€™s a conditional block at the top of this page that loops through all of the pages and posts, and then displays them if theyâ€™re anything but <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>. Thatâ€™s weird. Hereâ€™s an example of what it looked like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">for post in site.posts limit:site.tiles-count</code>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">if site.tiles-source == 'posts' and post.show_tile != false</code></p>

<p>It seems like this should do the trick if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">show_tile</code> frontmatter was not set as <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>, but thatâ€™s not the case here for some reason. So I changed the logic to only look at <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>. Hit refresh on the webpage, and <em>BOOM</em>, it worked. I can now see the correct tiles display on the index page. What a relief. Who knew it was just a logic thing.</p>

<p>The next update I want to make is adding some additional images/icons to the website, but I havenâ€™t exactly decided on how I want to do that, and what images those will be. Stay tuned.</p>
