I"«<p>Hi, if you didnâ€™t know already, my name is John Nutter. Iâ€™m a back end web developer and linux sysadmin. I have a passion working with Ruby on Rails, and seeking any opportunity I can to write code using it. In this first post, Iâ€™m going to go over some details on how I created this site, and the tools that I used. Itâ€™s not at all an exhaustive post, but just something I put together to get the ball rolling.</p>
