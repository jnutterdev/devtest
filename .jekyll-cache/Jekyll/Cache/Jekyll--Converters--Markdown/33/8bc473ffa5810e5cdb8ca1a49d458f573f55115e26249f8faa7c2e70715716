                      <p><p>The updates I’m going to be sharing lately will mostly be for the projects I’m working on. Which in this case, will just be the current website and also the <a href="https://www.nutterhomedesigns.com">Nutter Home Designs</a> website. Sometime in the near future, I’m going to be working on some Ruby on rails apps so I’ll share those as I’m working through them.</p>

                      <p><p>While in the process of updating the new website, I came across an issue building the links for my website. To rewind a bit, I previously used Jekyll on version 3.3.0 or even earlier. Sometime between now and then, there was a new update that rolled out that started using Bundler to bundle the gem dependencies for the project.</p>

                      <p><p>Hi, if you didn’t know already, my name is John Nutter. I’m a back end web developer and linux sysadmin. I have a passion working with Ruby on Rails, and seeking any opportunity I can to write code using it. In this first post, I’m going to go over some details on how I created this site, and the tools that I used. It’s not at all an exhaustive post, but just something I put together to get the ball rolling.</p>
