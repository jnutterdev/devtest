Hi, I'm John Nutter. I’m a customer support technician that has been working for an Atlanta based software company for the last seven years. I have a passion for web development, with some familiarity of PHP, Python, and Ruby.

My goal is to find a position as a full stack developer. I will also incorporate my understanding of programming languages, Linux systems, and my love of problem-solving and troubleshooting.

In my free time, I’m spending time with my wife and son, music production with [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/), or graphic design with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). I’ve released a few albums over the years, but mostly as a hobby.

I also really like any sci-fi, reading comic books, listening to podcasts, or catching up on the latest industry news.
