Hi, I'm John Nutter. I'm a full-stack developer with a background in technical and customer support. I enjoy working with a wide range of web technologies, but my most recent stack has been Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and PostgreSQL. I also enjoy working with Python and Django to create RESTful APIs and an affinity for Unix-based systems.

In my free time, I'm spending time with my wife and son, producing music with [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/), or graphic design with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). I also really like sci-fi, comic books, listening to podcasts, and catching up on the latest industry news.
