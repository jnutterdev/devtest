For my capstone project in the course, we created a travel itinerary app using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. We also used Redux to manage state. For styling we used Sass and Bulma. <!--more-->

There were three of us on the project: Tara, Kristin, and myself. Tara worked on setting up the database with PostgresSQL along with some of the Express routes. Kristin worked on setting up the routes in React to consume third party endpoints, Redux, and some components. And then I worked on setting up the Express server, front end styling, content, Heroku hosting, and external Postgres database. 

While we did stick with our notes, and get a working app up, we didn’t get to add everything in as we wanted. 

For me personally, the biggest struggle I had was getting the database setup with Postgres using Heroku’s plugin. It would not talk to anything. Finally I exported my local database and the copied that over to my hosting.
