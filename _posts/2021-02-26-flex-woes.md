For the last two days I've been slowly picking away at the Projects page of this blog. The underlying issue: getting all of the columns to display the same size. <!--more-->

I've tried everything I can think of, and searched for any possible work around but I'm at a loss. I'm wondering if it's just a calculation issue with flex box. I have 5 total columns, and the second to last column is shorter than the previous 3, while the very last one stretches full width of the page. I don't mind the last one stretching full width but it's beyond me why the 4th column is smaller.
